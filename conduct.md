Following our Emacs heritage, we use an adapted version of [Emacs Conduct](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel#toc3), covering `gitter.im/ensime/*` and `github.com/ensime/*`:

- Be helpful: others may not know where to look.
- Be proactive: read the documentation.
- Be useful: submit bug reports by following the template.
- Be respectful: don't insult or threaten others (intentional violators may be temporarily banned).

Of course the best conduct of all is to contribute code that improves ENSIME for everybody!
