If you use ENSIME every day and want to make sure that it is sustainable and continues to get better, please consider sponsoring our milestone plans.

ENSIME will always be free / libre software and primarily rely on our community for bugfixes and feature enhancements. But big changes take time that volunteers do not have, so we need to crowdfund it.

Please consider setting up a monthly donation at [salt.bountysource.com/teams/ensime](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/ensime) (a [libre platform](https://github.com/bountysource/core)).

We'd like to extend a special thank you to the following sponsors:
