Sorry, we lied. This page hasn't been written yet.

If a volunteer would like to pad out the following, that'd be great:

1. install java (prefer OpenJDK), point out jenv
2. install sbt (prefer sbt-extras)
3. checkout a basic tutorial project (maybe 99 problems, or 47 degrees)
4. point to specific parts of the sbt / editor installation guides, but come back here
5. start sbt and cheatsheet of basic commands
6. hello world in the editor without ensime
7. start ensime server
8. learning resources: odersky/venners, scalanator, coursera
9. reminder to read the documentation properly
