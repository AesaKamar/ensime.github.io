** Note: this plugin is currently experimental and works only with
ENSIME-server version 2.x **

This [CBT](https://github.com/cvogt/cbt) plugin provides the ability
to generate a `.ensime` file from a cbt build configuration.

## Install
Mix the `cbt.Ensime` trait into your build configuration.
```scala
import cbt._

class Build(val context: Context)
  extends BaseBuild
  with Ensime
```

## Run
Once the plugin installed, an ENSIME configuration file can be
generated by running:

```
cbt ensime
```

This configuration will contain the current cbt `BaseBuild` and all of
its dependent `BaseBuild`s as projects.

## Configure
The ENSIME configuration generated by CBT is fully customizable. Check
out the [plugin's ensimeConfig method](https://github.com/cvogt/cbt/blob/master/stage2/plugins/Ensime.scala#L25) for an overview of the various
settings. These settings may be modified in the usual CBT way, i.e. by
overriding the main method and copying settings. For example, to
change the version of Scala used by ENSIME, add the following snippet
to the CBT build configuration:

```scala
override def ensimeConfig = super.ensimeConfig.copy(scalaVersion = "<version>")
```
