Our intention is to keep ["an inclusive, welcoming and safe environment"](https://github.com/typelevel/general/issues/36) --- chat rooms that are free from hostile behaviour and discrimination.

As a member of Typelevel, we support the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html) (TL-CoC) as our golden source. But it is an ambiguous document that allows for a wide range of interpretations. We make the following clarifications to assure members of our commitment not to over-reach:

- There is no legal contract other than the software LICENSE.
- The TL-CoC covers gitter channels, github issues and pull requests. ENSIME does not organise events.
- Nobody will be punished for saying something accidentally offensive or insensitive.
- Nobody will be punished for getting into a technical argument: ideas can be attacked, but not people.
- Concerns should be directed to an admin. Contact `@fommil` if you are unsure who to ask.
- Admins may follow the [Fantasyland Code of Professionalism](https://github.com/fantasylandinst/fcop/blob/152297ce0fc3af1c8c03e05ecf737990652e9b60/COC.md), a structured framework to assess complaints.
- We will **not** contact anybody's employers, friends or family: a temporary ban from the community is the maximum penalty.

To address some specific points that have arisen:

- Banter around the [Church of Emacs](https://stallman.org/saint.html) and other parody religions is allowed.
- We get complaints if anybody says "pimp" instead of `implicit class`, `Ops` or `syntax`. Out of respect for those who are offended, and the ENSIME maintainers (who inevitably have to deal with it) please prefer the latter.
- Some who supported the [Statement on LambdaConf 2016](https://statement-on-lambdaconf.github.io/) have asked if we consider their actions to be Professional Sabotage. Firstly, the person who was no-platformed is not a member, so it's not relevant. Secondly, Typelevel has [already made a statement](http://typelevel.org/blog/2016/03/24/typelevel-boulder.html). However, we may ban an individual if they no-platform a member of the extended ENSIME community, including Typelevel, Scala, Emacs and the Free Software Foundation.
- If you provide evidence that you are being harassed elsewhere (e.g. you have received death threats on twitter) we can ban the harasser's known aliases / affiliates proactively.
- If you wish to contribute to ENSIME without agreeing to the TL-CoC, you can do so! Create a github Pull Request with your contribution containing `[TL-CoC-Rejected]` in the title and state the terms that you wish to use. Individuals may then opt-in to engage with you. This offer does not extend to gitter channels, github issues, or pull requests opened by others.
