Half the problem is working out which component of ENSIME is misbehaving.

The first thing to do is to read the Troubleshooting Guide for the editor:

- [ensime-emacs](/editors/emacs/troubleshooting/)
- [ensime-atom](/editors/atom/troubleshooting/)
- [ensime-vim](/editors/vim/troubleshooting/)
- [ensime-sublime](/editors/sublime/troubleshooting/)

and build tool plugin that you are using:

- [ensime-sbt](http://ensime.github.io/build_tools/sbt/#troubleshooting)
- [ensime-sbt](http://ensime.github.io/build_tools/maven/#troubleshooting)
- [ensime-sbt](http://ensime.github.io/build_tools/gradle/#troubleshooting)
