This is an area for Emacs Scala developers to contribute useful functions that they use as part of their custom workflow (they don't even have to be using ENSIME).

When adding a hack, please provide good lisp documentation along with some accompanying text explaining how you use the function as part of your workflow.

Some resources and examples:
