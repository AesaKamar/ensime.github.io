Thank you for using ENSIME on Atom!

Most tickets can be resolved easily by following a simple process.

1. nuke old versions of the ENSIME server
   - `rm -rf ~/.ivy2/cache/org.ensime`
   - `rm -rf ~/.ivy2/local/org.ensime`
2. use the latest release of `ensime` for Atom.
3. check the [tickets flagged as FAQ for Atom](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-atom/issues?labels=FAQ).
4. check the [tickets flagged as FAQ on the server](https://github.com/ensime/ensime-server/issues?labels=FAQ).
5. search for duplicates, especially the [most recently updated tickets](http://github.com/ensime/ensime-atom/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated)

If that solved your problem, great!
