ENSIME enriches your Sublime experience with the following features:

### Syntax highlighting

- Highlighting is semantic rather than regex-based.
- If you make a mistake, it is outlined in red.

### Mouse commands

- Right-clicking yields useful context menu items.
- `Ctrl-Click` or `Cmd-Click` invokes *Go to Definition*.
- `Alt-Click` invokes *Inspect Type at Point*.

### Keyboard

- Typing `Ctrl-Space` will show an autocomplete menu.
- Other keybindings can be added [via keymaps][configuration].

### Command palette

- Various options are available in the *Command Palette* (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). Search under *"Ensime"*.
