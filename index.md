# Intro

ENSIME brings Scala and Java IDE-like features to your favourite text editor, such as:

- Show inferred types.
- Contextual completion.
- Semantic highlighting with `implicit` expansions.
- Jump to source code or documentation.
- Refactorings (rename, organise imports).
- Errors and warnings in your code (i.e. "red squigglies").

ENSIME is [Libre Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and appeals to hackers, minimalists and connoisseurs - engineers and artists who craft their own exquisite tools and help their neighbour. If you would rather use a mainstream IDE, you will prefer [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/creating-and-running-your-scala-application.html) or [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/). We don't claim to be better, just different.
