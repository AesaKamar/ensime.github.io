ENSIME brings IDE features to your favourite text editor:

- Show the `type` of the symbol under the cursor.
- Contextual completion for `var`, `val` and `def`.
- Semantic highlighting with `implicit` expansion.
- Add an import for the symbol under the cursor.
- Fast classpath search (types and members).
- Jump to source code or documentation.
- Refactorings (rename, organise imports, extract method).
- Errors and warnings in your code: *red squigglies*.

To use ENSIME, you need a supported text editor and build tool. We recommend going to the [Getting Started](getting_started) section if you would like to learn more.
