ENSIME brings Scala and Java IDE-like features to your favourite text editor:

- Show inferred types.
- Contextual completion.
- Semantic highlighting with `implicit` expansions.
- Jump to source code or documentation.
- Refactorings (rename, organise imports).
- Errors and warnings in your code: *red squigglies*.

ENSIME appeals to hackers and aficionados. If you just want to use the most popular IDE, you will probably prefer [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.1/creating-and-running-your-scala-application.html).

If you would like to learn more, please read our [Getting Started](getting_started) section.

If you're a Scala beginner, our [Learning Scala](learning_scala) section has some excellent resources for you, and will help you get set up with a basic project.
