Fantastic, and welcome!

ENSIME has a JVM process that indexes your dependencies and understands your source code using the [scala interactive compiler](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/compiler/index.html#scala.tools.nsc.interactive.package) - the same compiler that compiles your code.

It is important to realise that ENSIME is not an IDE, it is just one tool in a toolbox, following the UNIX philosophy of [Do One Thing and Do It Well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well).

1. You must be using a [build tool that is supported](/build_tools/), to generate a `.ensime` file.
2. And you must be using a [text editor that is supported](/editors/), to start and connect to the JVM process.

If things don't work as you expected, please read the [Getting Help](/getting_help) guide before asking for help from the community.

We are all volunteers with our own priorities. Our approach to feature requests is "we will help you to implement it". Don't be scared, the ENSIME code is surprisingly easy to understand and you are invited to [Contributing](/contributing) to find out more. If you are coming from a corporate-sponsored IDE, this will be a liberating paradigm shift for you.

All interactions in ENSIME are governed by the [Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html).
