Fantastic, and welcome!

ENSIME has a JVM process that indexes your dependencies and understands your source code using the same [scalac](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/compiler/index.html#scala.tools.nsc.interactive.package) and [javac](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/) compiler that you use to build your project.

ENSIME is not an IDE, it is just one tool in a toolbox. You must also have:

1. a build tool to compile your project
2. a `.ensime` file describing your project layout. To generate this file, see [our list of build tool plugins](/build_tools/).
2. a text editor. See [our list of editor plugins](/editors/).

## Getting Help

If things don't work as you expected, please read the [Getting Help](/getting_help) guide before asking for help.

## Contributing

You are invited to read our [Contributing Guide](/contributing) and improve ENSIME. You'll get lots of help from existing contributors. Please take a moment to read [The Open Source Entitlement Complex](https://medium.com/@fommil/the-open-source-entitlement-complex-bcb718e2326d#.tvgf7fn0v) to understand why *we empower, but our contributors do not provide customer support*.

## Sponsoring

Whether or not you can help with direct contributions, [please consider sponsoring a developer](/sponsor).

## Conduct

Following our Emacs heritage, we use a trimmed version of [Emacs Conduct](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel#toc3) (some rules are redundant):

- These rules cover gitter channels, github issues and pull requests.
- Treat people with respect. No sexism, racism, homophobia, or discrimination.
- Donâ€™t put other people down, insult them, or threaten them.
- Be patient. You might not get an answer right away. People are not actively watching the channel all the time.
- Be friendly to newbies. They might not know what things are called or where to look for help, so you may want to suggest links or keywords to help them learn more.
- Violators of this code of conduct may be temporarily or permanently banned from the channel.
